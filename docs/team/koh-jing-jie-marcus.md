## Overview
Our project is a calorie tracker CLI program called LifeTracker. It allows the user to record down their daily net calorie gain, where the user can input the meals
he has consumed as well as the exercises that he has done.

In doing so, the user can better manage his daily calorie gain in order to meet their particular needs.
