## Overview
Our project, LifeTracker, is a calorie tracker CLI program. It allows the user to record down their daily net calorie gain, where the user can input the meals
he has consumed as well as the exercises that he has done.

In doing so, the user can better manage his daily calorie gain in order to meet their particular needs.

## Summary of Contributions

### Commands
Commands are the ways in which the user interacts with our program, through the usage of particular inputs that are defined as commands.
These are the main commands and entities that I worked on.

`view` command
* Allows the user to view their information via a simple lookup

`update` command
* Allows the user to update their information stored.

`user` entity
* The entity that initialises all the user's information.

### Database

### Contribution to team-based tasks
Implemented  the Ui for the indivdual commands. The Ui is used to improve the accessibility of the program to any potential users,
to ulimately make the program easier to use by streamlining the process for the user. The Ui consists of:
* General Ui - Handle the general commands as well as start up and exit of the program

## Project Management
* Managed release `v2.0` on GitHub

## UG/DG
* Added the introduction to the UG as well as a framework of explanation for the other members to build off
* Added Documentation for the `view` command
* Added explanation of program and user stories
